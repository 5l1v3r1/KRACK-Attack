# KRACK-Attack
Attempt at demonstrating "Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2"

## NOTE: This is currently in progress, and is expected to be completed October 20th, 2017


## Compiling
Windows only for now. Just compile KrackAttack.sln (Visual Studio 2017) in the desired configuration (Debug/Release) and Platform (Win32/x64).

I will later provide an older SLN file for those not yet upgraded to VS2017, as well as a CMake file.
